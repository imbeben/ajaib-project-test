# Ajaib-Project-Test / Example With Search and Filter

# Javascript (FE)

Every time developer add new config, please add the additional config into `config.js.development`.
Keep in mind that `config.js.development` will be used for building Multistaging.
  
**Keep in mind these rules:**

- Please maintain `config.js.development` based on your needs. Infra team only get the `config.js.development` for building multstaging.
- For `.env.development`, if it exists, the treatments are the same like the steps above. 
If you added config on `config.js.development` and the value will be different on new version, please added the value to `config.js.development`. Example, new config on `config.js.development` with new key is `new_value`. Then `config.js.development` will be:
```
-------- other config above --------
"new_value": {new_placeholder}
```
